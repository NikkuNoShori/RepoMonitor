# Favorites Feature Implementation

## Overview
The favorites functionality in RepoMonitor allows users to mark repositories for quick access and categorization. The implementation currently uses localStorage instead of a database solution, which was chosen for specific benefits.

## Current Implementation

### Storage Method
- Uses browser's localStorage
- Stores minimal data structure:
  ```typescript
  interface FavoriteRepository {
    owner: string
    name: string
    timestamp: number
  }
  ```

### Key Benefits
1. **Performance**
   - Instant access to favorites data
   - No network requests required
   - Zero database load

2. **Simplicity**
   - Self-contained implementation
   - No need for database migrations
   - Automatic cleanup on logout


### Integration Points
- Search results categorization
- Repository quick access
- UI state management


## Future Considerations
If requirements change, we might consider moving to a database solution if we need:
1. Cross-device synchronization
2. Analytics on favorite patterns
3. Team-wide favorite sharing
4. Persistent favorites across sessions
