# Debug Attempts: analyzed_by_user_id Syntax Error

## Error Description
```sql
ERROR: 42601: syntax error at or near "analyzed_by_user_id"
LINE XXXX: analyzed_by_user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete set null,
```

## Attempted Solutions

### 1. Fix Reference in Initial Schema
- Changed `analyzed_by_user` to `analyzed_by_user_id`
- Updated reference to include `(id)`: `REFERENCES auth.users(id)`
- Updated all related indexes and policies
- **Result**: Error persisted

### 2. Uppercase SQL Keywords
- Updated all SQL keywords to uppercase (CREATE, TABLE, REFERENCES, etc.)
- Made data types uppercase (UUID, BIGINT, etc.)
- Standardized SQL formatting
- **Result**: Error persisted

### 3. Split Column Addition and Foreign Key
- First added column without constraint
- Added foreign key constraint separately
- **Result**: Error persisted

### 4. PL/pgSQL DO Block Approach
- Wrapped column additions in PL/pgSQL DO block
- Used information_schema to check column existence
- Added each column individually
- **Result**: Error persisted

### 5. Complete Separation of Concerns
- Added columns without constraints
- Added foreign key constraints separately
- Added NOT NULL constraints last
- Included constraint dropping
- **Result**: Error persisted

### 6. Remove IF NOT EXISTS
- Removed all IF NOT EXISTS clauses from ALTER TABLE
- Added foreign key constraint directly in column definition
- Made is_public NOT NULL directly in definition
- **Result**: Error persisted

### 7. Separate ALTER TABLE Statements
- Split each column addition into its own ALTER TABLE statement
- Added UUID column first without constraints
- Added foreign key constraint separately
- Added NOT NULL constraint after setting defaults
- **Result**: Error persisted

## Key Findings
1. The combined migrations file shows multiple instances of the same migrations being repeated
2. There are inconsistencies in how auth.users is referenced across different parts of the file:
   - Some places use `auth.users(id)`
   - Others use just `auth.users`
   - Some references point to a custom `users` table instead of `auth.users`
3. The error might be related to the combined migrations file format rather than the individual migration files

## Common Elements Across Attempts
1. All attempts maintained the reference to `auth.users(id)`
2. All attempts tried to add the column with UUID type
3. All attempts included ON DELETE SET NULL
4. All attempts used ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN syntax
5. All attempts tried to modify the existing table directly

## Not Yet Tried
1. Using a different column type for the foreign key (e.g., TEXT instead of UUID)
2. Creating a temporary table and migrating data
3. Using a different constraint name format
4. Checking if there's a conflict with existing constraints
5. Verifying the auth.users table structure
6. Using ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ONLY syntax
7. **Fixing the combined migrations file generation process**
8. Creating a new table with desired schema and replacing the old one
9. Using a different foreign key syntax (e.g., FOREIGN KEY clause after all columns)
